A lightweight editor

# Where's everything gone?

Due to circumstances far beyond my control I've had to change the name of this repo and revert / remove all history. 

The plugin **will** be back. Very soon. It will be "bigger, stronger, faster", sharing nothing in common with it's bygone brother other than being a WYSIWYG editor. 

If you'd like to know why this change has taken place in more detail, feel free to contact me on Twitter. 

But for now please bear with me. Forger.js is coming soon :)

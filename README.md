Forger.js
=========

forge:

* create (something) strong, enduring, or successful.
* move forward gradually or steadily.

A lightweight editor

# Where's everything gone?

There's a detailed explanation of the 'why' [here](https://kerrygallagher.co.uk/whered-it-go/)

Due to circumstances far beyond my control I've had to change the name of this repo and revert / remove all history. 

The plugin **will** be back. Very soon. It will be "bigger, stronger, faster", sharing nothing in common with it's bygone brother other than being a WYSIWYG editor. 

But for now please bear with me. Forger.js is coming soon :)
